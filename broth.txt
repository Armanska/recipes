BROTH RECIPE

INGREDIENTS/ 6 SERVINGS
- 1 chicken weighing about 2 kg or 2 large thighs and 1 chicken body with neck and wings - about 2 kg of meat,
- 300 g of beef, e.g. entrecote, brisket, eyelet,
- offal: 10 hearts and 5 chicken stomachs or 1 turkey neck,
- 3 liters of water,
- 2 carrots, 1 white parsley, 1 onion, 2 sprigs of parsley, a piece of celery, a leek, an optional cabbage leaf,
- spices: 1 tablespoon of sea salt, 3 grains of allspice, 1 bay leaf, 4 whole grains of pepper.

PREPARATION
If we have a whole chicken, it should be cut into parts - cut off the neck, wings, thighs. Leave the body together with the breasts.
Rinse all parts of the chicken, beef and giblets, then place in a large pot and cover with cold water. Season and cook over medium heat.
Once boiling, reduce the heat and cook over low heat with the lid slightly ajar for about 1 and 1/2 hours.
In the meantime, prepare the vegetables: peel the carrot, parsley and celery (or for a better aroma - just wash them thoroughly). 
Rinse the onion, leek and parsley (do not peel the onion, its scales will give the soup a nice color).
Put the vegetables in the broth and bring to a boil. 
Add spices: allspice, bay leaf and black pepper. 
Reduce heat and cook over low heat for about 1 hour or up to 1 and 1/2 hours.
Serve the broth hot, with cooked noodles, chopped parsley, thinly sliced carrots from the broth and pieces of chicken meat.

TIPS
Delicious broth can be cooked only from chicken without beef and giblets. Just add a little less water. 
The next day, the rest of the broth can be used to prepare TOMATO SOUP.
